# Income and Life Expectancy Reanalysis Project
This repository contains data and code for the reanalysis of the 2016 JAMA paper: The Association between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001 - 2014, by Raj Chetty, Michael Stepner, Sarah Abraham, Shelby Lin, Benjamin Scuderi, Nicholas Turner, Augustin Bergeron, and David Cutler. The Journal of the American Medical Association (2016), Vol 315, No. 14. 

(P.S. This project was developed as the final project for the 'Data Science for Economists' course at UC Berkeley, and it was subsequently refined and expanded upon.)

## Technology Used
- **Anaconda**: A Python environment with Jupyter Notebook is required for interacting with the project.
- Installation: Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to download and install Anaconda for your operating system.
- Launching Jupyter Notebook: After installing Anaconda, launch Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda; it will open in your default web browser, where you can create and manage notebooks.
- Accessing the Project: In the web browser, navigate to the folder where you've downloaded this repository. Open the `.ipynb` file named `reanalysisproject_helen.ipynb`.

## How to Use
1. Download the repository by clicking the 'Code' button and selecting 'Download ZIP' at the top right corner.
2. Extract the ZIP file on your computer.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`reanalysisproject_helen.ipynb`) for an interactive analysis.
4. Alternatively, view the `reanalysisproject_helen.pdf` for a static representation of the Jupyter Notebook's content.
5. For any queries or assistance, feel free to contact me at yhuan199@alumni.jh.edu.

## Usage
- `reanalysisproject_helen.ipynb`: Contains interactive cells for data processing, analysis, and visualization. 
- `reanalysisproject_helen.pdf`: Provides a non-interactive, detailed view of the analysis, mirroring the content in the Jupyter Notebook.
- `health_ineq_all_online_tables_raw.xlsx` & `health_ineq_all_online_tables.xlsx`: The datasets used in the analysis; one is the raw version, and the other is a processed version of the raw data, accompanied by a codebook for reference.
- `tl_rd22_us_state`: A folder for geographic mapping in the analysis. These files are automatically utilized by the Jupyter Notebook and do not require direct interaction.
